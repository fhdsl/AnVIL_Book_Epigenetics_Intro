# Nature versus Nurture

This lecture module introduces epigenetics. It provides background on DNA packaging within cells, and a review of how epigenetics fits within the "Central Dogma" of molecular biology - the process of turning DNA into RNA into protein.

**Learning Objectives**

1. Answer “what is epigenetics?”
1. Learn about why we think about epigenetics as "Nature versus Nurture"

## The Legacy of Trauma: Can Experiences Leave A Biological Imprint?

Can epigenetics explain why descendants of trauma victims seem to have worse health outcomes? Bianca Jones Marlin and Brian Dias dive into epigenetics and its role in trauma inheritance on the [Shortwave Podcast](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/16/947232031/the-legacy-of-trauma-can-experiences-leave-a-biological-imprint).

## Exploring the history of epigenetics, and what the future may hold for the field

In [this Nature Podcast Extra](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03877-7), Nick Howe speaks to Edith Heard, Director General of the EMBL, and Giacomo Cavalli, from the Institute of Human Genetics, exploring the history and future of epigenetics.
