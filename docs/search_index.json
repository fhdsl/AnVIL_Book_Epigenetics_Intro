The first activity, Explore the Epigenome leverages the UCSC Genome Browser - a powerful tool for visualizing genomic differences. This book is part of a series of books for the Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). Skills Level Genetics Beginner: minimal prior knowledge/skill helpful Programming skills Novice: no programming experience needed Learning Objectives Learning objectives for this activity come from the Genetics Core Competencies: Discuss how DNA is packaged in the chromosomes in terms of histones, nucleosomes, and chromatin. Defend how most cells can have the same genetic content and yet have different functions in the body. Contrast the packaging of DNA into euchromatin versus heterochromatin in the context of histone modification, and DNA modification (where applicable). Discuss the potential roles of DNA modification, histone modification, and non-coding RNA in epigenetic inheritance, both somatic and germline. Discuss environmental impacts on epigenetic systems. Describe how differential histone modification modulates gene activity and is utilized in developmental progression.

It provides background on DNA packaging within cells, and a review of how epigenetics fits within the “Central Dogma” of molecular biology - the process of turning DNA into RNA into protein.

Can epigenetics explain why descendants of trauma victims seem to have worse health outcomes? Bianca Jones Marlin and Brian Dias dive into epigenetics and its role in trauma inheritance on the Shortwave Podcast. 2.2 Finding out if more than your DNA passes on to the next generation In this episode of Genetics Unzipped, Dr. Kat Arney takes a look at the world of epigenetics - finding out if more than DNA passes on to the next generation, whether Darwin was wrong and Lamarck was right, and how to pimp your genome. 2.3 Instructions for Life: How Food, Stress, and Our Genes Shape Our Health In this episode of Population Healthy, Experts from the University of Michigan School of Public Health unpack how our genes respond to changes in our diets, stress levels, and exposure to toxins—and what these interactions mean for human health. 2.4 Exploring the history of epigenetics, and what the future may hold for the field In this Nature Podcast Extra, Nick Howe speaks to Edith Heard, Director General of the EMBL, and Giacomo Cavalli, from the Institute of Human Genetics, exploring the history and future of epigenetics. 2.5 The Effect of lncRNAs on Chromatin and Gene Regulation (John Rinn) In this episode of Epigenetics Podcast, Dr. John Rinn from the University of Colorado in Boulder discusses the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in regulating the expression of genes and chromatin organization.

Ensure “Human” is selected under “Browse/Select Species”. You will be working from the Human Assembly March 2006 (NCBI/hg18). Make sure this is selected under the “Find Position” dropdown menu. Enter HOXA7 in Position/Search Term and select GO. Your Genome Browser should now look like this: 3.2 Clean up Visual Settings You’ll now use the following directions to remove the default visual settings. Scroll below to different menu options shown. Under the “Mapping and Sequence” tab, Base Position should be set to dense. Under the “Genes and Gene Predictions” tab, RefSeq Genes should be set to pack. All other features should be marked as hide. You will need to go through each of the menu options to make sure features are marked as “hide”. Please note you will need to open each menu option by select the “+” to ensure all tracks are turned off (marked as hide). At the end of the browser page, select “refresh”. Your browser should look like the image below, where only HOXA7 is shown. 3.3 Zooming Out Zoom out your display by 10x, 3x or 1.5x to see HOXA1-HOXA13 genes on your browser. The zoom out value you’ll select will be dependent on your computer display screen. You may need to use the zoom in option if you’ve zoomed out the display beyond the HOXA1-HOXA13 genes. Zoom buttons can be clicked more than once. Ideally your browser should like the image below. Instead of zooming in and out, you can always manually enter your chromosome region of choice. For this exercise, try entering the following region: chr7:27,087,367-27,235,317. Click “go”. You could also enter chr7:27,087,367-27,235,317 in the search bar at the start of this exercise instead of HOXA7. 3.4 Selecting Histone Marks Now we’ll visualize histone marks to show that the same chromosome locus can have drastically different histone patterns. Scroll down to the “Regulation” menu and click the Broad Histone track hyperlink. Scroll down and deselect all boxes. Select H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks for H1-hESC and NHLF. To learn more about these options you can click on their blue hyperlinks for more information. H3K4me3 is a known histone mark on Histone 3 (H3). It occurs on lysine 4 (K4) and has three methyl groups (me3) that indicate active gene expression. In other words, the DNA is open and ready to be accessed. H3K27me3 is a known histone mark on on Histone 3 (H3). It occurs on lysine 27 (K27) and has three methyl groups (me3) that indicate inactive gene expression. In other words, the DNA is closed off and cannot be accessed. The H1-hESC cell line consists of embryonic stem cells. The NHLF cell line consists of lung fibroblasts. Fibroblasts are important for building the connective structures around cells and healing wounds. Scroll below and deselect the Peak views. You will only need Signal views. Your selected subtracks should only display Signal views as shown below. Click “Submit”. Scroll down, and your browser should look like the image below. 3.5 Comparing Histone Marks Let’s first examine the H1-hESC cell line (embryonic stem cells). Signals are high for the H3K27me3 histone mark. You’ll also notice that H3K4me3 signals are minimal. This signal pattern demonstrates that embryonic stem cells are in the repressed chromatin configuration at the HOXA locus and indicates that HOXA genes in blue are not expressed in this cell line. Now, let’s examine the NHLF cell line (lung fibroblasts). The pattern is different for NHLF. H3K4me3 signals are high for the first half of the HOXA locus, but low for the second half of the locus. H3K27me3 signals are low and then high for the same locus. This signal pattern demonstrates that for lung fibroblasts only half of the HOXA locus is expressed while the other half is not expressed. Specifically, we can use the full image to see that HOXA1-7 are expressed (turned on). We can also see that HOXA9-13 is not expressed (turned off).
