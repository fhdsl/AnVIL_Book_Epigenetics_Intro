## About this course

This course serves as an activity intended as an introduction to the field of epigenetics, or the idea of “nature versus nurture”. The first activity, "Explore the Epigenome", leverages the UCSC Genome Browser - a powerful tool for visualizing genomic differences. This book is part of a series of books for the Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). 

## Learning Objectives

This course will teach learners to:  

- Discuss how DNA is packaged in the chromosomes in terms of histones, nucleosomes, and chromatin.
- Defend how most cells can have the same genetic content and yet have different functions in the body.
- Contrast the packaging of DNA into euchromatin versus heterochromatin in the context of histone modification, and DNA modification (where applicable).
- Discuss the potential roles of DNA modification, histone modification, and non-coding RNA in epigenetic inheritance, both somatic and germline.
- Discuss environmental impacts on epigenetic systems.
- Describe how differential histone modification modulates gene activity and is utilized in developmental progression.

Learning objectives for this activity come from the Genetics Core Competencies
