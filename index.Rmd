## Learning Objectives {-}

Learning objectives for this activity come from the [Genetics Core Competencies](https://genetics-gsa.org/education/genetics-learning-framework/):

- Discuss how DNA is packaged in the chromosomes in terms of histones, nucleosomes, and chromatin.  
- Defend how most cells can have the same genetic content and yet have different functions in the body.  
- Contrast the packaging of DNA into euchromatin versus heterochromatin in the context of histone modification, and DNA modification (where applicable).  
- Discuss the potential roles of DNA modification, histone modification, and non-coding RNA in epigenetic inheritance, both somatic and germline.  
- Discuss environmental impacts on epigenetic systems.  
- Describe how differential histone modification modulates gene activity and is utilized in developmental progression.
